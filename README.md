# ❇️ Spotify player/widget
### Why?
As often, I couldn't sleep so I thought about a webpage where I can see what I'm currently listening (which is kind of idiot), and then I remembered that my parents were curious about what I'm listening far from their home. That's why I made this, so that they can sometimes go to a self-hosted webpage and see what I'm listening to.
### How?
This is a two-in-one project:
- **Front-end part:** the code for the client, the humans who will browse to the website. (HTML + CSS + JS)
- **Back-end part:** the code running on a server that sends API requests to Spotify and process the data. (TypeScript)

# 📦 Dependencies
## 📡 Back-end part

You must run the `server.tsx` with [Deno](https://deno.com/) after installing [query-string](https://www.npmjs.com/package/query-string) with the following command:
```bash
npm i query-string
```
